"Scalability"
Why does everyone want to tackle scalability.
You have no users.
// Phrased a little bit more seriously ...
// 
// It's valuable to not solve problems you don't have.
// Every tool has tradeoffs, there is no perfect hammer.
//
// But that also implies if you solve a problem you don't have,
// you are implicitly doing work to be worse at a problem you do have

Very cool project though, actually the kind of thing many offices need.
Done right this could be a very real service.

When I was in undergrad I worked in a microbiology labratory for a summer.
And during that summer we had to take measurements of uniform petri dishes.
We used a ton of man hours, and did not get replicatable results.

This sort of automation is actually an extremely likely use for AI automation.
And one which is not at all trivial for people outside of the field to accomplish.

tasks:
+

tests:
Your test cases are a bit sparse.

And you want generally want these two things to be true:
    Does the phrasing of your test make sense to an end user? // "User Perspective"
    Is it obvious how to convert your test into a unit test? // test "case"

Hopefully that's because y'all are planning on prototyping quickly and will write test cases as you go.
// Rather than because you don't plan on testing non-manually ^_^;;
// (Although in truth that works fine for some projects)

Neat project.
On Thursday's lab we're going to want a UI wireframe.
And of course it'd be good to verify if the OCR libraries work for your goal by then.
// There are certainly libraries that should be able to do the task. So that's a good sign.
